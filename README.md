# Raspberry Pi Character Display Controller (in Scala!)

**A video demonstration of this code can be found [here](https://youtu.be/mayvLA2KwRA)!**

This code is meant to control a [character display](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=16x2+character+display) from a Raspberry Pi using [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface) in Scala.

This code makes use of [pi4j](http://pi4j.com), a Java library that grants easy access to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins, in the Scala environment.
